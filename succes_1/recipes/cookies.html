<h1>Cookies</h1>

<p><h4>In the wide world of desserts, cookies are perhaps 
    the friendliest and most versatile treat. They can be 
    as simple as shortbread, an elemental combination of 
    flour, sugar, and butter, or as time-intensive and 
    beautiful as these Brown-Butter-Cardamom Spitzbuben, 
    each one featuring a jewel-like cutout of jam. 
    They can be studded with chocolate chips or used to 
    sandwich lemon curd, dulce de leche, or minty white 
    chocolate. You can roll them out and cut them out or 
    just dollop them onto a sheet pan. Perhaps your 
    childhood included a cookie of particular significance 
    to you. Maybe, like Food & Wine associate features 
    editor Nina Friend, your family cookie recipe is so 
    good it spurred the creation of a small business.</h4></p>
    

<p><h4>No matter which cookies you favor, now's the 
    time to get baking. Crucially for 2020, cookies 
    are portable and easy to share while maintaining 
    a social distance, and endlessly adaptable to suit 
    various tastes and dietary restrictions. You can 
    also wrap them up and put them in the mail, and 
    (carefully) deliver them to friends and neighbors 
    less messily than a pie or cake. If your household 
    is small, you can freeze them to ensure holiday 
    baked-goods abundance will stretch into the new year.</h4></p>
