<p><h4>Low glycemic index diets have been shown to improve 
    glucose tolerance in healthy and diabetic people. 
    However, it is necessary to diversify the diet with 
    foods with low glycemic response. In this study, three 
    partially substituted pasta made with semolina and flour
     legumes (12% Phaseolus vulgaris, Vigna sinensis 10%, 
     12% of Cajanus cajan) were formulated and its cooking 
     quality, acceptability, glycemic index and glycemic 
     load were assessed. We found that the incorporation 
     of legumes impacts the cooking quality and sensory 
     characteristics of the product, increasing cooking 
     losses between 78% and 557%, and the content of 
     soluble proteins between 14% and 32%. In relation 
     to the sensory characteristics, increases in hardness 
     and stickiness were observed, without altering the 
     overall appreciation (9 on a scale of 0 to 10). 
     An Improvement of on the nutritional quality was 
     observed, increasing the protein content between 
     19% and 26%. The glycemic index value found for 
     the three pasta formulations resemble the type of 
     slow and intermediate carbohydrate absorption.

    tres pastas de sémola parcialmente sustituidas con 
    harina de leguminosas (12% Phaseolus vulgaris, 10% 
    de Vigna sinensis, 12% de Cajanus cajan) y evaluaron 
    la calidad de cocción, aceptabilidad, índice glicémico 
    y carga glicémica de las mismas.</h4></p>
