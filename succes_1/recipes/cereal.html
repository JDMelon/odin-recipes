<h1>Cereal</h1>
<img src="../images/cereal.jpeg">
<p><h4>cereal, also called grain, any grass (family Poaceae)
     yielding starchy seeds suitable for food. Most grains 
     have similar dietary properties; they are rich in 
     carbohydrates but comparatively low in protein and 
     naturally deficient in calcium and vitamin A. Breads, 
     especially those made with refined flours, are usually 
     enriched in order to compensate for any nutritional 
     deficiencies in the cereal used. The cereals most 
     commonly cultivated are wheat, rice, rye, oats, 
     barley, corn (maize), and sorghum.</h4></p>

     <p><h4>As human food, cereals are usually marketed in 
        their raw grain form (some are frozen or canned) 
        or as ingredients of various food products. 
        As animal feed, they are consumed mainly by 
        livestock and poultry, which are eventually 
        rendered as meat, dairy, and poultry products for 
        human consumption. Many cereals are used 
        industrially in the production of a wide range of 
        substances, such as glucose, adhesives, oils, and 
        alcohols.</h4></p>
